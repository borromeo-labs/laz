# Laz

Laz is a personal expenses tracker software on the browser.

### Why

After years of tracking, we find ourselves losing all motivation to track any expense every now and then.

This procrastination turns into days, weeks, and on a few occassions - months.

This software is designed so that you only spend a minute a day to think out loud every expense you remember.

We minimize every interaction so there's little to no barrier to log your expenses.

## Running Development Mode

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Afterwards, open up `http://localhost:3000`.
